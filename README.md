# Express Prisma

This is a sample node.js express application created to test supertokens auth with Prisma orm. We use planetscale as the databse. This API follows real-world specs (https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/endpoints), well mostly, except for signup and sign in since they use supertokens.


## Lessons Learned

Q - What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

A - One of the things I realised is that express error handler function should have 4 parameters. I also learnt how to organise code in an express app for scale and also learnt how to integrate supertokens and how to use prisma with node.js. Also experimented with a cool databse called planetscale.
